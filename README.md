<div><h1 align = center>About Me 🌸(●'◡'●)</h1>

<p>I am a Junior Game Developer from Argentina, currently working on **Goblin Cleanup**, a commercial game developed in **Unity**.

My day-to-day work focuses on **gameplay programming**, with a strong emphasis on systems, interactions, and **persistence (Save & Load)** in both singleplayer and multiplayer contexts. I work extensively with **Unity, C#**, and networked gameplay, collaborating closely with designers, QA, and other developers to deliver stable features and fixes.

Before transitioning fully into game development, I worked for over a year as a **Java developer**, building enterprise applications and backend systems. That experience gave me a solid foundation in **object-oriented programming, clean code, and maintainable architectures**, which I actively apply to my game development work.

Beyond games, I have a strong interest in **data science and machine learning**. You’ll find projects here related to **neural networks**, built from scratch as part of my academic and personal exploration of the field. I enjoy understanding how systems work under the hood, whether it’s gameplay mechanics or learning algorithms.

I also have experience with **web development and UX/UI**, and earlier in my career I worked with **augmented reality**, developing filters using Meta Spark.
