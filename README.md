<h1>About Me 🌸(●'◡'●)</h1>

<h2>A passionate video game enthusiast from Argentina with a background in video game development using Unity. I specialize in creating immersive menus and HUDs that enhance the gaming experience. Additionally, I have experience in augmented reality, having developed various filters using Meta Spark.

Apart from game development, I also have skills in web design, particularly in applying UX/UI principles to create engaging and user-friendly websites.

When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me exploring the vast realms of World of Warcraft or in the Summoner's rift.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me!</h2>
